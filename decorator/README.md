Exercise: Timing Function Execution
Objective: Create a decorator that measures the execution time of a function. The decorator should print the time taken to execute the function each time it is called.

Requirements:
Create a Decorator:

Define a decorator called time_it that:
Takes a function as an argument.
Measures the time taken for the function to execute.
Prints the execution time in seconds.
Use the Decorator:

Create a simple function that performs a time-consuming task, such as calculating the Fibonacci sequence recursively or simulating a delay using time.sleep().
Apply the time_it decorator to this function.
Test the Decorator:

Call the decorated function multiple times and observe the output to verify that the execution time is being printed correctly.
